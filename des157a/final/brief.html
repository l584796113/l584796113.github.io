    <h1>Final Brief</h1>
    <h2>Comparison Project 1:</h2>
    <p>This website shares the same intention as my project where it shows the picture of the cars. However, it uses a different layout. It’s a good way to show many cars at once. The navigation bar is user friendly which allows users to sort and find the car they want quickly. When hovering over, the image will turn grey and the title will appear. The interaction is clear and interesting. The navigation bar is the most helpful one. I’m thinking of creating a better navigation for my project.</p>
    <h2>Comparison Project 2:</h2>
    <p>This website is also gallery based. It has options of slide show and grid layout. The grid layout is good for overviews of photos. The interface moves as the mouse moves around, which is very user friendly. For the slide show, the scroll works and the user can also drag the vertical line for moving. There is an overlay of title for each photo when it is scrolled to that photo. The background also changes color when scrolling to different photos. I think this is awesome because different photos may look better on different backgrounds. Overall, I think the website is working very well. </p>
    <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
    <p>My project goal is to create a car gallery that lets users enjoy the visualization of different views of the cars and makes them feel that the cars are realistic. It’s similar to the project above in terms of the intention. But, what is different is the layout and the overall feeling. My goal is to make users be immersed in the show. 
    </p>
    <h2>Design Strategies:</h2>
    <p>The overall look will look professional and immersive. The car will be all cropped out for clarity and neatness. The image of the car will be the main focus and others will be minimized to reduce distractions. </p>
    <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
    <p>The interaction will be with scrolling. The soft scroll will slide back and center the image. The hard scroll will slide to the next photo and center it. The dots indicate how many photos there are and which photo the user is looking at. I’m thinking of adding a grid view for all cars and incorporating the hover interactions. When hovering on the photo, the name of the car will appear with a grey transparent background.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
    <p>The users will feel enjoyable and interested when looking at those car images. They will feel the cars are realistics like what they see in real life. And they should be amazed by the beauty of the cars. </p>
