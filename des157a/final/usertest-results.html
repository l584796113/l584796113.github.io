        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>My users for testing were Jackie, Everlyn, and Vladimir. During the test, they all had issues with scrolling. They tried to drag the image for sliding instead of wheeling. BladmierDuring the test. </p>
        <p>To click the header of the page for returing to homepage seems unreasonable and cofusing. Users could not figure it out without instructions.</p>
        <p>It's difficult for users who do not know car much to figure out which model to select.</p>
        
        <h2 >Plan</h2>
        <p>Based on the observations and feedback I recieved from my classmates, I'm planning to make few changes. The first one is to create a homepage button so that users can go back to the homepage. The second change I will make is to try in inform users about how to scroll by wheel. The last but not the least change I will make is to have a option for users to view all cars so they will not need to know the model of cars.</p>
