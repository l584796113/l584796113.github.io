        <h2>Best Practices For Form Design</h2>
        <h3>10/18/2021</h3>
        <p>To summarize from the article, a good design practice should be well-organized, user-friendly with focus. A single-column content is suggested to make the content flow both organized and easy for readers to focus on content line by line. Information should be organized neatly so that not too much information is crowded together. A multiple steps form is suggested to solve the issue of content overflow and guide users through the process. The steps should be from easy questions to harder ones. The input should only include the necessary information and some user-friendly notes are helpful, such as optional fields, where to enter, and what to enter. Unnecessary elements should be avoided to prevent distractions. The content should be clear in contrast to the background. Text size needs to be legit. </p>

        <p>The purchasing website of Apple.com works very well. First, the content is in one column. Besides, it has multiple steps. Other steps are lightened to help users focus on the current steps. After each step, the website will even scroll for you so that your eye can focus on the next step more. The design is really clean and user-friendly.   </p>
