        <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
        <h3>11/10/2021</h3>



        <p>There are many game design techniques that can make the user experiences much better. First, when designing apps for phones or pads, we should consider the comfort area that most users can touch. The article does not mention the desktop as the mouse can move around. But, my idea is to keep the interaction in the places where users view the most, avoiding users to travel their eyes from one side to another back and forth. The article also mentioned sliders. It's important for users to know that they can slide and give them ability to slide to the first one if the list is long. I think sliders are great techniques because it saves spaces while giving users all the contents. The pop up is also useful. the article suggests that there should not be X button as you want the users to focus on the content. I totally agree with that. The purpose of most pop-up is to grab users attention and call for actions. We should not create things that distract them to do so.</p>

        <h2>Every Picture - Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>
        <h3>11/1/2021</h3>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <p>This image is interesting because it's neatly trimmed. The car color and clean white background makes users to really focus on the car itself. The car itself is a very cool car and rare. I took it at the car show. It's conceptual and people are unlikely to see it in real life. This image relate to my collection as my collection is all about cars. My collection tells that I'm a car lover and like to take photograph of cars. Also, I took my photos neatly and edit them afterwards. And it may reveal that my dream is to own a super car.</p>

        <figure id="second">

        </figure>

        <p>The image is a street photo. There are some colorful buildings at the other side of the street. The most interesting of image is the color and tone of the lights in buildings. The lower building has a warm color and tint color at another side. The taller building has a very cool color. They creates some great contrast with each other. The most mysterious aspect of the photo is where it was taken and what story author is trying to tell.</p>

        <h2>Every Picture</h2>
        <h3>10/27/2021</h3>
        <p>The website I chose is a shopping website. The difference betweeen it and other shopping website is that its image is interactive while other website's image is just still. When the user slide to the set, that set will light up. In addittion, the modal will distort toward where your mouse moves, which really grabs users' attention and encourage users to focus on the set. When clicking into the set, the modal has a live picture where it can rotate up to 90 degree like VR. Other website only offers still side or front view. When the user scrolls down, there is a fluent flow in images that direct users' eyes from top to down. </p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h2>
        <h3>10/20/2021</h3>
        <p>Modal is a pop-up window that lays over the parent page. It has the most priority and focus, where the user won't able to access the parent page. Thus, modal is good way to catch audience's attention and get the required information. It can also be used to make alert that will prevent users to further access before checking the errors. For designing the modal, there should be clear title showing what the modal is about. Then, there needs to be few buttons for closing or access the modal.  </p>


        <p>I think it's a good idea to implement this into our madLib project. The fill in blank can be pop out to get users' input. It will be also good for alerting an error. </p>

        <h2>Best Practices For Form Design</h2>
        <h3>10/18/2021</h3>
        <p>To summarize from the article, a good design practice should be well-organized, user-friendly with focus. A single-column content is suggested to make the content flow both organized and easy for readers to focus on content line by line. Information should be organized neatly so that not too much information is crowded together. A multiple steps form is suggested to solve the issue of content overflow and guide users through the process. The steps should be from easy questions to harder ones. The input should only include the necessary information and some user-friendly notes are helpful, such as optional fields, where to enter, and what to enter. Unnecessary elements should be avoided to prevent distractions. The content should be clear in contrast to the background. Text size needs to be legit. </p>

        <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-13-pro">Apple Purchasing Site</a></p>

        <p>The purchasing website of Apple.com works very well. First, the content is in one column. Besides, it has multiple steps. Other steps are lightened to help users focus on the current steps. After each step, the website will even scroll for you so that your eye can focus on the next step more. The design is really clean and user-friendly.   </p>
