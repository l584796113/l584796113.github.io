        <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
        <h3>11/10/2021</h3>



        <p>There are many game design techniques that can make the user experiences much better. First, when designing apps for phones or pads, we should consider the comfort area that most users can touch. The article does not mention the desktop as the mouse can move around. But, my idea is to keep the interaction in the places where users view the most, avoiding users to travel their eyes from one side to another back and forth. The article also mentioned sliders. It's important for users to know that they can slide and give them ability to slide to the first one if the list is long. I think sliders are great techniques because it saves spaces while giving users all the contents. The pop up is also useful. the article suggests that there should not be X button as you want the users to focus on the content. I totally agree with that. The purpose of most pop-up is to grab users attention and call for actions. We should not create things that distract them to do so.</p>
