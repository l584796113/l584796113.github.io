        <p>This image is interesting because it's neatly trimmed. The car color and clean white background makes users to really focus on the car itself. The car itself is a very cool car and rare. I took it at the car show. It's conceptual and people are unlikely to see it in real life. This image relate to my collection as my collection is all about cars. My collection tells that I'm a car lover and like to take photograph of cars. Also, I took my photos neatly and edit them afterwards. And it may reveal that my dream is to own a super car.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>The image is a street photo. There are some colorful buildings at the other side of the street. The most interesting of image is the color and tone of the lights in buildings. The lower building has a warm color and tint color at another side. The taller building has a very cool color. They creates some great contrast with each other. The most mysterious aspect of the photo is where it was taken and what story author is trying to tell.</p>
